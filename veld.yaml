      "transformed NER data from APIS. 'Uncleaned' means that the indices of the annotated entities
      sometimes are slightly off, and lose something of the word or take in whitespaces. This can be
      a problem with spaCy which is very strict on token boundaries.  For the cleaned data, the
      indices of the uncleaned data were corrected to match precise token boundaries.  Redundancies
      and overlaps were removed."
