      description: "transformed NER data from APIS. 'Uncleaned' means that the indices of the
        annotated entities sometimes are slightly off, and lose something of the word or take in
        whitespaces. This can be a problem with spaCy which is very strict on token boundaries.  For
        the cleaned data, the indices of the uncleaned data were corrected to match precise token
        boundaries.  Redundancies and overlaps were removed."
